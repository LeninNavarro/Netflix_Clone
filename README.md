##### Experience log

(Lenin, 21/11/2022) 
 For a week, I've been trying to catch up on the fundamentals of tailwindCSS and CSS itself, due to the confusion of mixing flexbox and grid displays. I have been getting the groove of it until I encountered a self-made roadblock: attempting to make a video background while displaying a text over the said video, which has proved to be a difficulty until now. Onto my other task which is the FAQs section, much thanks to my partner in this project for starting a template which I can reference when I'll start redoing it with some JavaScript to make it more dev-ish(?) and appending more experience to both our learning curves through the course of this project. I've still got a lot to polish with regards to my front-end development skills and I trust this project will reveal more holes to my skills, concludingly meaning that I can patch it/them up before (hopefully) landing a job.
